# Project Instructions for AI Coding Agents

**Last updated:** 2025-10-03

## Project Overview

**the-pool** is a modern C++ thread pool implementation that provides efficient task-based parallelism. It manages a fixed-size pool of worker threads that execute tasks asynchronously with support for futures, backpressure control, and graceful shutdown.

### Key Features

- Fixed-size thread pool with configurable worker count
- Task queue with configurable maximum size (default: 10,000)
- Support for both blocking (`Enqueue`) and non-blocking (`TryEnqueue`) task submission
- Future-based task results using `std::future`
- Synchronization primitives for waiting on task completion (`WaitForAllTasks`)
- Thread-safe operations with proper RAII cleanup
- Backpressure handling to prevent queue overflow

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: C++23
- **Standard Library**: STL threading primitives
  - `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::condition_variable`
  - `std::future`, `std::packaged_task`
  - `std::atomic`, `std::function`
- **Build System**: CMake 3.10+
- **License**: MIT License (2025)

## Coding Conventions

### C++ Style

- **Header Guards**: Use `#ifndef __FILENAME_H_INCL__` pattern with double underscores
- **Naming**:
  - PascalCase for class names (e.g., `ThreadPool`)
  - PascalCase for public methods (e.g., `Enqueue`, `WaitForAllTasks`)
  - camelCase with trailing underscore for private members (e.g., `stop_`, `workers_`)
  - PascalCase for private methods (e.g., `SignalThreadsToStop`, `GetNextTask`)
- **Template Placement**: Template implementations in header file (required for templates)
- **Documentation**: Doxygen-style comments with `///` and `\brief`, `\param`, `\return`, `\note`, `\throws` tags
- **Whitespace**: Braces on same line for methods, consistent 4-space indentation
- **Comparisons**: Yoda conditions for constants (e.g., `true == stop_`, `0 == activeTasks_`)

### Design Patterns

- **RAII**: Constructor creates threads, destructor joins them
- **Non-copyable**: Delete copy constructor and assignment operator
- **Lock Management**: Use `std::unique_lock<std::mutex>` for automatic unlock
- **Condition Variables**: Clear predicates in lambda form for `wait()` calls
- **Move Semantics**: Prefer `std::move()` for task extraction from queue

### Thread Safety

- All public methods are thread-safe
- Mutex protection for shared state (`queueMutex_`)
- Atomic variables for frequently-accessed flags (`stop_`, `activeTasks_`)
- Three condition variables for different synchronization needs:
  - `condition_`: Worker threads waiting for tasks
  - `finished_`: Callers waiting for all tasks to complete
  - `queueNotFull_`: Producers waiting for queue space

### Error Handling

- Throw `std::runtime_error` for invalid operations (e.g., enqueue on stopped pool)
- Document potential exceptions with `\throws` in comments
- Document system errors (e.g., thread creation failures)

## Build Commands

Build system is CMake-based. Standard workflow:

```bash
# Configure (static library by default)
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..

# Configure for shared library
cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..

# Build
make

# Install (optional)
sudo make install
```

Compiler requirements: C++23 support required (GCC 11+, Clang 13+, MSVC 2022+)

## Best Practices

### Task Enqueueing

- Use `Enqueue()` for normal task submission (blocks briefly if queue full)
- Use `TryEnqueue()` for non-blocking submission in high-throughput scenarios
- Always check the returned future if you need the task result
- Handle `std::runtime_error` when enqueueing might occur after shutdown

### Queue Management

- Default queue size (10,000) is suitable for most scenarios
- Adjust `maxQueueSize` in constructor for memory-constrained or high-throughput applications
- `Enqueue()` uses 100ms timeout when queue is full to balance backpressure vs. deadlock prevention

### Synchronization

- Use `WaitForAllTasks()` at synchronization points where all work must complete
- Be aware that `WaitForAllTasks()` blocks until queue is empty AND all active tasks finish
- The destructor automatically waits for threads to finish, no manual cleanup needed

### Performance Considerations

- Worker threads use move semantics to extract tasks from queue
- Tasks execute outside of lock scope for maximum concurrency
- Active task counter uses atomics to minimize lock contention
- Condition variables minimize busy-waiting

### Code Documentation

- Maintain comprehensive Doxygen comments for all public APIs
- Explain synchronization logic in implementation comments
- Document why certain patterns are used (e.g., "prevents deadlock")
- Include thread safety notes in method documentation

## Working with AI Coding Agents

### Instruction File Management

This project uses a two-file instruction system:

1. **`AGENTS.md`** (this file) - Primary instructions for AI coding agents
2. **`.github/copilot-instructions.md`** - Simple pointer file that references AGENTS.md

### Update Protocol

**When to update AGENTS.md:**

- Coding standards, conventions, or project decisions evolve
- New patterns or best practices are established
- Technology stack changes
- Build system or tooling updates

**Update requirements:**

- Maintain the "Last updated" timestamp at the top
- Add entries to the "Recent Updates & Decisions" log at the bottom with:
  - Date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
  - Brief description of changes
  - Reasoning for the change
- Preserve the document structure: title header → timestamp → main instructions → "Recent Updates & Decisions" section

**Do NOT modify `.github/copilot-instructions.md`** unless the reference mechanism itself needs changes.

### Commit Workflow

When committing changes:

1. Stage the changes using git commands
2. Write detailed but concise commit messages using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
3. **CRITICAL: NEVER commit automatically** - always wait for explicit confirmation from the user
4. Present the staged changes and commit message for review before proceeding
